Maginot is a Java based work order / help desk application that is easy to use, setup, and configure.

Maginot was originally written for a school district during a transition period. The project surpassed its original expectations and became an excellent alternative to some high priced (and bloated) help desk management solutions. Given more time and an open source community, this project can become even more than it has already.

Just as a side note, you have to configure a Server before you can connect a client.
